[Restarone Solutions Inc](https://www.restarone.com/) is a software engineering and design agency focused on building greenfield products & supporting the tech community through education and mentorship.

At Restarone Solutions, we help startups build software products by [supporting the entire software development lifecycle](https://www.restarone.com/services). 

## Our 4-step process:

1.  Discovery, Scope & Strategy
2.  Design & Prototyping
3.  Development
4.  Launch & Maintenance

By implementing this four-step process, we can ensure that we remain true to the client's vision by asking the right questions, providing high fidelity prototypes, setting up test and staging environments and providing assistance every step of the way.

We serve a vibrant client-base ranging from late stage startups like [Copper](https://www.copper.com/) to angel investors like [Sanjay Singhal](https://sanjaysinghal.com/) and ambitious non-profits including the [Nikean Foundation](https://nikean.org/).

[Our expertise](https://www.restarone.com/about) is deep, diverse and above all, rare. We are [open-source evangelists](https://github.com/restarone/) and a published software vendor for [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/lenny-mobi/id1528051136), [Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Restarone+Solutions+Inc.&hl=en_CA&gl=US), [Amazon](https://www.credly.com/badges/517d04da-3c81-4839-95de-495a8de262c3?source=linked_in_profile) and the greater internet. We deliver scalable, production-grade software that is the result of industry best practices such as test-driven development and the [12 factor methodology](https://12factor.net).

## [Our services](https://www.restarone.com/services)

-   Product Design
-   Mobile App Development

We have a [team](https://www.restarone.com/about) of capable, multi-talented contributors who are passionate about software development and design, delivering nothing but the best. We believe that everyone should play to their strengths. Our diverse team does just that across many disciplines, ranging from software engineering, design, marketing, project management and the arts.

Software development is a complex process involving product development, design and engineering. We greatly reduce this complexity by centralizing the talent and process needed to bring a product from kick-off to completion.

## Work With Us

At [Restarone](https://www.restarone.com), everyone is an independent contributor in-charge of their own work and schedule. Each member of our team draws their weekly goals from our global backlog and sees them to completion, collaborating with other team members to deliver comprehensive results.

If you're goal-oriented like us, enjoy your artistic freedom and have strong but loosely held opinions-- then this may be the sign you've been looking for. [Contact us](mailto:contact@restarone.com) for more information on how you can be a part of [Restarone](https://www.restarone.com).
